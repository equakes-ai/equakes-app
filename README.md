# equakes

Equakes.ai deals with a concerning, but relatively obscure problem: earthquake aftershocks. Earthquake aftershocks can happen within 150 kilometers of a given epicenter. They can occur as late as a year after the earthquake initially happened. Earthquakes, aftershocks in particular, disproportionately affect the disabled population. Prediction of these aftershocks can help mitigate the loss of accessibility they cause, by letting city leaders and appointed offficials understand where their risks are and determine a comprehensive plan including their disabled constituents. This results in disabled residents not being forced out of areas that are prone to natural disasters, of which a large swath is coastal cities, areas at high risk of gentrification. Benefits of this include disaster mitigation, prevention of housing inequality (existing disabled owners do not have to move out), and better understanding of natural disaster patterns.

## Running

The app runs on flutter, a cross-platform framework that relies on dart. To install, we'll presume that you already have flutter.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/equakes-ai/equakes-app equakes
